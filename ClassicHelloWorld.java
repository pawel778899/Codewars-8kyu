public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}



// DESCRIPTION:
// You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

// Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

// Here's how it will be tested:

//     java Solution.class parameter1 parameter2
// Hints:

// Check your references
// Think about the scope of your method
// For prolog you can use write but there are better ways
// If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
// FUNDAMENTALS
